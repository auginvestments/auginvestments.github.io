        	<h1>Silvercorp Mining</h1>

          <div class="col-lg-12 faq-item" data-aos="fade-up">
          	<p>Silvercorp Metals recently amended its buyout offer of Guyana Gold Fields. The new terms of the deal offer Guyana Gold Shareholders $0.25 per share in cash and a share conversion of 0.1849 shares of Guyana Gold per share of Silvercorp. Guyana Gold Field's mine is transitioning from an open pit mine to an underground operation, which is Silvercorp's area of expertise. I anticipate them to resolve the current operational issues and achieve a high rate of return on this acquisition based on their history of exceptional operating results.<p> 

          	<p>This buyout increases Silvercorp's exposure to gold and offers them the ability to be a well diversified mining company that mines silver, zinc, lead and gold. Due to the vast amounts of zinc and lead that it currently mines, its All-in-sustaining-costs (AISC) have been much lower than the price of silver for many years. Although, recently Silvercorp's price has come under pressure due to the COVID-19 virus, silver prices have regained much of their losses and so has the share price. However, further upside can be achieved in this stock.<p>

          	<p>One key investment Silvercorp obtained is its roughly 28.9% ownership in New Pacific Metals Corp (NUAG), which is currently valued at roughly $220 million USD. Considering Silvercorp's market cap is currently roughly $722 million USD, with growth in earnings expected to be achieved through its current operational mines and through the acquisition of Guyana Gold Fields, Silvercorp can grow its share price by 50% or more.<p>

          	<p>Silvercorp's 2021 guidance offers investors a glimpse into their potential earnings for the coming year. They are expected to produce 6.2-6.5 million ounces of silver, 66.1-68.5 million pounds of lead and 24.7-26.7 million pounds of zinc. Using today's prices for lead and zinc, their AISC can be predicted to be $7.65 per ounce of silver (using mid-range of production values). This value can fluctuate due to the prices of zinc and lead. As of today, this cost versus the current price of silver offers a $10+ operating margin for the price of silver per ounce produced by Silvercorp. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be $42.4 million USD, estimating mineral resources taxes and depreciation and amortization to be $5 million and $20 million respectively, this leads to a gross profit of roughly zero. However, as the manufacturing in China ramps up, the prices of zinc and lead will rise, growing Silvercorp's operating margin and silver has also heavily lagged the price of gold and is expected to rise and close the gap to gold. This will allow Silvercorp the potential to be highly profitable and once the gold production from Guyana Gold Fields is brought into the company, this will further increase profits and offers large upside of over 50% the current share price of roughly $5.70 CAD. Another key factor is the potential ramp up of a mine currently owned by Silvercorp that is expected to produce roughly 30,000 ounces of gold per year.<p>

          	<p>You might remember our most recent post of the merger between Alacer and SSR Mining. I expect this recent drop in Silvercorp's stock to be attributed to this buyout, similar to the drop experienced the day of the Alacer and SSR Mining merger. In the following week Alacer and SSR Mining went on to rise roughly 30% and it is highly possible that Silvercorp experiences similar growth in the coming weeks or months.<p>

          	<p>Lastly, another key factor to consider is Silvercorpâ€™s share buyback program where they have launched an agreement to purchase up to 8,670,104 shares, which represents 5% of the company and could also help lead to further future upside.<p>

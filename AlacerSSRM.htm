<h1>Alacer Gold & SSR Mining</h1>

<p>Alacer had recently reported their 1st quarter results in which they produced over 89,000 ounces of gold at an All-In-Sustaining-Cost (AISC) of $700 per ounce. Operating margin is currently $1,000 per ounce, offering substantial free cash flow generation for Alacer Gold. They also have amazing growth prospects with other properties that are currently undergoing exploration, offering further organic growth. With Gold currently hovering around $1,700 Alacer Gold is extremely undervalued company that will become net cash positive during this 2nd quarter.<p>

<p>SSR Mining is set to report their 1st quarter results on May 14th and although they had experienced mining operations suspensions, the effect on the 1st quarter will not be significant. I expect SSR Mining to report a positive 1st quarter earnings result, in which they will continue to increase their large net cash position (currently $238 million). This offers the newly combined company large financial flexibility to reinvest in itself and to even potentially make another beneficial acquisition.<p>

<p>I strongly recommend these companies, specifically Alacer Gold as there may potentially even be a competing offer that will be more accretive to shareholders.<p>

<p>The link to the presentation for the combined company can be found here. I believe the current estimated free cash flow potential of roughly $450 million per year to be conservative, I expect this value to grow upon the resumption of mining for SSR Mining and the continued bullish trend in Gold. However, even with this conservative estimate, the current $3.65 billion valuation for this combined equity comes at a large discount. As long as the price of gold continues to hover around $1,700 or continues to increase, I expect the combined entity to reach a market cap of over $5 billion, representing upside of over 35%.<p>

<p>If the combined entity does not rise, I expect it to be an acquisition target for the large cap mining companies such as Newmont (NEM) or Barrick (GOLD) due to its vast free cash flow potential.<p>

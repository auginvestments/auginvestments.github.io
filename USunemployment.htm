<h1>US Unemployment at 14.7%, No Rush for Further Stimulus</h1>

<p>Believe it or not, this unemployment number was better than expected. With the White House in no rush to provide further stimulus, some might wonder how can stocks continue moving higher? Many investors had discussed how these job numbers would be the end of this most recent bull run, but momentum is still in favour of the bulls. Friday there was a large out-performance in the Russell 2k, proving the resilience of the small cap companies and overall optimism in Wall Street.

<p>There is in fact lots to be optimistic about:
<br>The reopening of the economy
<br>New vaccines being progressed through to the next stages of their trials
<br>Infection curves plateauing
<br>Risk of death being lowered through better treatment of COVID-19.

<p>In my opinion, this optimism will continue unless their is a resurgence of cases due to this reopening. Experts have been stating phase 2 might commence in the fall or end of summer, this could allow the market to continue its run over the next few weeks/months. Another important assumption in this new bull market is that there will be a sharp recovery in unemployment levels in the coming weeks or months due to potential pent up demand. Therefore, while this optimism is still alive, I expect the markets to continue their grind higher, albeit at a slower pace since we have moved up sharply in a very short time.<p>

<p>I would recommend to continue investing in stocks that offer long term growth value. Particularly stocks that will benefit from the increased use and advancement of technology in the workplace. Gold is also a great pick as it will continue to benefit in times of increasing government debt and the expansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.<p>

<p>Check in early next week for one of my top picks going forward.

<h1>Why Value?</h1>

<p>In times of extreme volatility and panic we find the true value in companies.<p>

<p>In the past decade the only net buyers of stocks have been companies who have repurchased their shares to artificially raise their share price. Although you may be inclined to hop on board, this train does not go on forever. The way in which these companies have pursued this is very troubling. Instead of using their free cash flow to reinvest into their actual businesses, many companies have used vast amounts to repurchase shares and have even used debt to repurchase these shares. Here at Value Investing we strive to pick companies who are properly capitalized and who reinvest in their own business as we believe that organic growth is much more sustainable.<p>

<p>Tune in for some past picks I made prior to creating the blog. You will see the value in Value Investing.

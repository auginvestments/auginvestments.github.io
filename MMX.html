          <p>Maverix Metals Inc is a royalty company that offers a pure play exposure to the price of gold with future growth and optionality. Maverix Metals (MMX) currently has 128 million shares outstanding with an implied current market capitalization of $622 million USD. This market cap puts MMX into the emerging royalty companies category, however, with significant near-term potential MMX will look to tap into the mid-tier sector which will allow significant growth and alpha for investors. What we find very interesting is a large ownership by Newmont (23%), Pan American Silver (20%) and Kinross (9%) along with the management, board and insiders (10%) respectively. These institutions and insiders hold a combined 62% of the outstanding shares, in fact management is furthering its ownership by purchasing shares in the public market earlier this July.<p>

          <p>With this royalty model, Maverix is able to obtain full exposure to rising gold and silver prices, future exploration upside, massive diversification that operators cannot obtain, with minimal exposure to operating costs and capital costs. Management has proven themselves by executing on all six of its goals from 2019 by deploying $120+ million into growing their portfolio of royalty streams, being listed on both the TSX and NYSE, shown an increase in trading liquidity, increased annual cash flow and credit facility, announced a quarterly dividend in January 2020 of $0.01 USD per share and lastly they were also able to increase their research coverage.<p>

          <p>In terms of their operational results, in 2019 MMX obtained Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEOs) of 24,000 ounces. However, prior to withdrawing their guidance due to Covid-19 related suspensions, MMX was expected to obtain 27,000-30,000 GEOs representing a mean growth rate of 18.75%. In Q1 of 2020, MMX grew its GEOs sold to 5,871 from 4,358 year over year, representing a 35% growth in GEOs. There were some operational suspensions at several of its royalty streams (specifically within Mexico), but starting in June these operations were all fully up and running. Based upon all these factors we are anticipating GEO production of approximately 24,000, in line with last years numbers, however MMX will obtain significantly increased revenue and profit due to the run up in gold and silver prices. We also expect MMX to continue to deliver and grow its GEOs production based upon newly acquired streams, further investment by utilizing its cash position or future earnings and future streams that will be coming online in the near future.<p>

          <p>Lastly, in 2020 MMX has key value creation steps that will aid shareholders value creation by deploying US$100 Million for royalty or stream acquisitions, further increasing trading liquidity, organic growth from current portfolio, diversify shareholder base and most importantly achieve trading liquidity targets to qualify for indices (GDXJ).<p> 

          <p>From a technical perspective please refer to the chart below.<p>

          <p> <img src ="MMXchart.png"

          <p>We see support from the Exponential Moving Average at $6.32 CAD, this price was currently achieved and held on July 23, 2020 which leads us to believe and expect further upside to our short-term target of $7 CAD. The Relative Strength Indicator confirms this scenario with lower lows and an anticipated higher high upon this rise. We see a similar setup in the Moving Average Convergence Divergence and Stochastic Oscillator. Assuming our target of $7 is achieved we would take some profits at this price and expect a decline to the Exponential Moving Average, however as long as gold and silver continue to show strength we expect this company to eventually push through the $7 resistance supported by many indicators and expected operational results which will show a growth in earnings.<p>

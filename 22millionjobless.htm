        	<h1>22+ Million Jobless Claims & What's Next?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="row  d-flex align-items-stretch">
          <div class="col-lg-12 faq-item" data-aos="fade-up">

          <p>Today the US made history. Continuing jobless claims has reached almost 23 million people and it's still climbing higher.<p>

          <p>The disconnect between the stock market and the actual economic landscape has reached hysterical levels. How is this possible? The federal reserve has been printing trillions of dollars and dumping it into the bond market in order to try and stop a full on depression. But how long can this last? Read More The federal reserve has stated they will do whatever it takes, leaving the door open for "unlimited QE (Quantitative Easing)". Unfortunately, this has implications that our society and economy will have to confront in the future. The short term implications was a rush into the stock market because bond yields were at all time lows, this causes an increase in multiples (multiple expansions) since the risk free rate (10 year yield) is so low. This is what we have been experiencing in the last month+, the question is, can it continue? Major indices have seen a 30%+ run, jobless claims continue to increase, insolvencies have begun, how does this make sense? It doesn't. However, there are parts of the market that have indeed benefited from this black swan event.<p>

          <p>Technology companies that benefit from a stay at home society and offer services or products that can lower the operational costs of companies have been soaring to all time highs. Although this may benefit the short term, the major indices, specifically the S&P 500 and Russel 2k have exposure to smaller companies who are being forced to close their business and take large amounts of debt to hope for a better tomorrow where they will be able to reopen. These companies and investors are ignoring the large amounts of debt and are assuming that the consumers will be back soon because of "built-up demand". These companies are specifically airlines, restaurants, hotels and retail. These are huge employers and without these jobs how can the consumer return to their previous spending? Short answer, it can't, it will take many years for the consumer to recover and consumer spending is approximately 2/3 of the economy.<p>

          <p>The next issue is the large forward P/E multiples we have been experiencing lately. Although forward earnings have seen negative revisions, stocks have continued to gain and this has exacerbated the forward P/E multiple. We should be experiencing a higher than average forward multiple based upon the multiple expansion due to the lower 10 year yield, this disconnect has grown too large and will eventually correct.<p>

          <p>So what does all this mean? In my opinion, over the next few weeks or potentially months we will experience a correction that takes all this negative data into account and the future data of a potential second wave that will again cripple our economy even more. The fed is there for the economy, offering downside risk so maybe we don't break the previous lows of March 23, maybe we don't even reach those lows. However, there will be a pullback to consolidate this huge run up.<p>

          <p>So how do we play this next leg? I believe that technology will continue to perform well (maybe a slight temporary correction when the overall market moves lower). Banks and financials will face significant downsides due to insolvencies and potentially loan provision troubles, meanwhile gold will continue to surge. Again there may be a potential short-term correction for gold but just as it did recently, it will then surge higher due to the increased uncertainties and further fed stimulus.<p>

          <p>The fed balance sheet is currently over $6.5 trillion and is set to increase to over $9 trillion by years end. Don't fight the fed. It will be there to support the economy. However, in the short to medium term the fed has stated there will be no new policies or expansion of policies unless it is needed. Therefore, be ready for this next phase. On the next drop the fed will begin its new policies, creating another bottom in the stock market and creating gold's next leg up.<p>

          <p>I'll be posting some value picks for small-medium gold producers that are extremely cheap with gold at $1,700.</p>

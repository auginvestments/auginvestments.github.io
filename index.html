            <h4>Worrying Signs in The Market</h4>
            <p>
              Last week Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve released their most recent economic data and important projections for the economy. They again focused on their commitment to keeping interest rates near zero for at least until the end of 2023, increased their asset purchase program, and committed to inflation averaging in the long term. We find that their inflation targets of over 2% do not line up with their current inflation expectations targets and this entails a gap in the current stimulus packages and/or the need for lower interest for longer than just the end of 2023.<p>

            <h4>The Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell Hit Another Home Run for Gold and Silver</h4>
            <p>
              June 10th, 2020 Jerome Powell and the Fed released important economic projections and their plans on dealing with the fallout of COVID 19. Powell has stated, “we are not even thinking about thinking of raising rates”. Interest rates are set to hold steady at 0-0.25% until at least 2022, meanwhile the Fed has also stated they will continue their purchases of bonds in order to ensure adequate liquidity.<p>

            <p>
              As mentioned in my previous post, markets have grinded higher. However, recently we have seen a rotation out of high growth stocks (predominantly technology) into value stocks (predominantly financials). The reopening of the economy and renewed beliefs for the fight against COVID 19 has peaked the interest of investors into stocks that have been hardest hit by this Black Swan event. We have also witnessed a decline in gold and silver, especially in the miners. <p>

            <h4>US Unemployment at 14.7%, No Rush for Further Stimulus</h4>
            <p>
              Believe it or not, this unemployment number was better than expected. With the White House in no rush to provide further stimulus, some might wonder how can stocks continue moving higher? Many investors had discussed how these job numbers would be the end of this most recent bull run, but momentum is still in favour of the bulls. Friday there was a large out-performance in the Russell 2k, proving the resilience of the small cap companies and overall optimism in Wall Street.<p>

            <p>
              Today the US made history. Continuing jobless claims has reached almost 23 million people and it's still climbing higher.<p>

              <p> The disconnect between the stock market and the actual economic landscape has reached hysterical levels. How is this possible? The federal reserve has been printing trillions of dollars and dumping it into the bond market in order to try and stop a full on depression. But how long can this last? <p>

              <p> In the past decade the only net buyers of stocks have been companies who have repurchased their shares to artificially raise their share price. Although you may be inclined to hop on board, this train does not go on forever. <p>

Maverix Metals (MMX) currently has 128 million shares outstanding with an implied current market capitalization of $622 million USD. This market cap puts MMX into the emerging royalty companies category, however, with significant near-term potential MMX will look to tap into the mid-tier sector which will allow significant growth and alpha for investors.<p>

              Kirkland Lake Gold is set to resume its normal-course issuer bid (“NCIB”), in which it will be allowed to purchase up to 10% of its outstanding shares. Last month, Kirkland had paused this program due to potential impacts of COVID 19, however, management now sees that they can put their excess capital to work and focus on returning it to shareholders. <p>

              Before the market opened today on May 11, Alacer Gold and SSR Mining have comes to terms for an "at the market merger". Each share of Alacer Gold will receive 0.3246 SSR Mining Share per Alacer share held. Initially, markets seemed to like this merger, however, the optimism quickly faded with both companies dropping approximately 10%. <p>

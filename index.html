            <h4>US Unemployment at 14.7%, No Rush for Further Stimulus</h4>
            <p>
              Believe it or not, this unemployment number was better than expected. With the White House in no rush to provide further stimulus, some might wonder how can stocks continue moving higher? Many investors had discussed how these job numbers would be the end of this most recent bull run, but momentum is still in favour of the bulls. Friday there was a large out-performance in the Russell 2k, proving the resilience of the small cap companies and overall optimism in Wall Street.<p>
              <a href="#about" class="btn-get-started animated fadeInUp scrollto">Read More</a>

              <p> There is in fact lots to be optimistic about:<p>
              The reopening of the economy<p>
              New vaccines being progressed through to the next stages of their trials <p>
              Infection curves plateauing<p>
              Risk of death being lowered through better treatment of COVID-19. <p>

              <p> In my opinion, this optimism will continue unless their is a resurgence of cases due to this reopening. Experts have been stating phase 2 might commence in the fall or end of summer, this could allow the market to continue its run over the next few weeks/months. Another important assumption in this new bull market is that there will be a sharp recovery in unemployment levels in the coming weeks or months due to potential pent up demand. Therefore, while this optimism is still alive, I expect the markets to continue their grind higher, albeit at a slower pace since we have moved up sharply in a very short time. <p>

              <p> I would recommend to continue investing in stocks that offer long term growth value. Particularly stocks that will benefit from the increased use and advancement of technology in the workplace. Gold is also a great pick as it will continue to benefit in times of increasing government debt and the expansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. <p>

              <p> Check in early next week for one of my top picks going forward.

            <h4>22+ Million Jobless Claims & What's Next?</h4>
            <p>
              Today the US made history. Continuing jobless claims has reached almost 23 million people and it's still climbing higher.<p>

              <p> The disconnect between the stock market and the actual economic landscape has reached hysterical levels. How is this possible? The federal reserve has been printing trillions of dollars and dumping it into the bond market in order to try and stop a full on depression. But how long can this last?  
              <a href="#about" class="btn-get-started animated fadeInUp scrollto">Read More</a>
              The federal reserve has stated they will do whatever it takes, leaving the door open for "unlimited QE (Quantitative Easing)". Unfortunately, this has implications that our society and economy will have to confront in the future. The short term implications was a rush into the stock market because bond yields were at all time lows, this causes an increase in multiples (multiple expansions) since the risk free rate (10 year yield) is so low. This is what we have been experiencing in the last month+, the question is, can it continue? Major indices have seen a 30%+ run, jobless claims continue to increase, insolvencies have begun, how does this make sense? It doesn't. However, there are parts of the market that have indeed benefited from this black swan event. <p>

              <p> Technology companies that benefit from a stay at home society and offer services or products that can lower the operational costs of companies have been soaring to all time highs. Although this may benefit the short term, the major indices, specifically the S&P 500 and Russel 2k have exposure to smaller companies who are being forced to close their business and take large amounts of debt to hope for a better tomorrow where they will be able to reopen. These companies and investors are ignoring the large amounts of debt and are assuming that the consumers will be back soon because of "built-up demand". These companies are specifically airlines, restaurants, hotels and retail. These are huge employers and without these jobs how can the consumer return to their previous spending? Short answer, it can't, it will take many years for the consumer to recover and consumer spending is approximately 2/3 of the economy. <p>

              <p> The next issue is the large forward P/E multiples we have been experiencing lately. Although forward earnings have seen negative revisions, stocks have continued to gain and this has exacerbated the forward P/E multiple. We should be experiencing a higher than average forward multiple based upon the multiple expansion due to the lower 10 year yield, this disconnect has grown too large and will eventually correct.<p>

              <p> So what does all this mean? In my opinion, over the next few weeks or potentially months we will experience a correction that takes all this negative data into account and the future data of a potential second wave that will again cripple our economy even more. The fed is there for the economy, offering downside risk so maybe we don't break the previous lows of March 23, maybe we don't even reach those lows. However, there will be a pullback to consolidate this huge run up. <p>

              <p> So how do we play this next leg? I believe that technology will continue to perform well (maybe a slight temporary correction when the overall market moves lower). Banks and financials will face significant downsides due to insolvencies and potentially loan provision troubles, meanwhile gold will continue to surge. Again there may be a potential short-term correction for gold but just as it did recently, it will then surge higher due to the increased uncertainties and further fed stimulus. <p>

              <p> The fed balance sheet is currently over $6.5 trillion and is set to increase to over $9 trillion by years end. Don't fight the fed. It will be there to support the economy. However, in the short to medium term the fed has stated there will be no new policies or expansion of policies unless it is needed. Therefore, be ready for this next phase. On the next drop the fed will begin its new policies, creating another bottom in the stock market and creating gold's next leg up.<p>

              <p> I'll be posting some value picks for small-medium gold producers that are extremely cheap with gold at $1,700.

              <p> In the past decade the only net buyers of stocks have been companies who have repurchased their shares to artificially raise their share price. Although you may be inclined to hop on board, this train does not go on forever.

            <h4>Alacer Gold & SSR Mining</h4>
            <p>
              Before the market opened today on May 11, Alacer Gold and SSR Mining have comes to terms for an "at the market merger". Each share of Alacer Gold will receive 0.3246 SSR Mining Share per Alacer share held. Initially, markets seemed to like this merger, however, the optimism quickly faded with both companies dropping approximately 10%. <p> 

               <a href="#about" class="btn-get-started animated fadeInUp scrollto">Read More</a>

              <p> Alacer had recently reported their 1st quarter results in which they produced over 89,000 ounces of gold at an All-In-Sustaining-Cost (AISC) of $700 per ounce. Operating margin is currently $1,000 per ounce, offering substantial free cash flow generation for Alacer Gold. They also have amazing growth prospects with other properties that are currently undergoing exploration, offering further organic growth. With Gold currently hovering around $1,700 Alacer Gold is extremely undervalued company that will become net cash positive during this 2nd quarter.<p>

              <p> SSR Mining is set to report their 1st quarter results on May 14th and although they had experienced mining operations suspensions, the effect on the 1st quarter will not be significant. I expect SSR Mining to report a positive 1st quarter earnings result, in which they will continue to increase their large net cash position (currently $238 million). This offers the newly combined company large financial flexibility to reinvest in itself and to even potentially make another beneficial acquisition. <p>

              <p> I strongly recommend these companies, specifically Alacer Gold as there may potentially even be a competing offer that will be more accretive to shareholders. <p>

              <p> The link to the presentation for the combined company can be found here. I believe the current estimated free cash flow potential of roughly $450 million per year to be conservative, I expect this value to grow upon the resumption of mining for SSR Mining and the continued bullish trend in Gold. However, even with this conservative estimate, the current $3.65 billion valuation for this combined equity comes at a large discount. As long as the price of gold continues to hover around $1,700 or continues to increase, I expect the combined entity to reach a market cap of over $5 billion, representing upside of over 35%. <p>

              <p> If the combined entity does not rise, I expect it to be an acquisition target for the large cap mining companies such as Newmont (NEM) or Barrick (GOLD) due to its vast free cash flow potential. <p>

              <p> Disclosure: I am long ASR (Alacer Gold). I wrote this article myself, expressing my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for this post and have no business relationship with the companies mentioned in this article.

          <p>Last week Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve released their most recent economic data and important projections for the economy. They again focused on their commitment to keeping interest rates near zero for at least until the end of 2023, increased their asset purchase program, and committed to inflation averaging in the long term. We find that their inflation targets of over 2% do not line up with their current inflation expectations targets and this entails a gap in the current stimulus packages and/or the need for lower interest for longer than just the end of 2023. All of this plus increased government spending to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 have greatly increased US Public Debt to GDP and the price of gold is highly correlated to this.<p>
          
          <p>Therefore, we believe that both gold and silver will outperform in the longer term. The temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines and the temporary repurchase agreement facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA repo facility) through March 31, 2021, will help control the surge in the USD. However, the USD has still managed to cross above an important resistance level and commodities such as gold and silver have suffered respectively. With volatility also breaking its downtrend, turning to the upside along with the USD we see markets are poised for further downside in the coming weeks. Some ways to protect against this downside risk are through the Volatility Index (VIXY or VXX), and Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (UUP), iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF (SHY). Investing in volatility is inherently risky therefore we recommend a very small portion of your portfolio should go into this position, but it can help mitigate the potential upcoming losses.<p>

          <p> <img src ="VXX.png"
         alt ="VXX Chart" > <p>

          <p>We see a double bottom has formed around the $23.70 level and expect that the gap towards $28.2 will fill. This is very concerning for the broader market, including and not limited to technology, commodities, and financials.<p>

          <p>When panic sets in, there are few places to find shelter. Investors and traders are very knowledgeable in these places therefore they can become extremely crowded and this increased demand creates a surge in value of these safe haven bets. This is the exact reason why our team finds it prudent to have a percentage of your portfolio set aside in investments such as: VIXY/VXX, UUP, and SHY.<p>

          <p>On the bright side, the Federal Reserve constantly is reassuring investors that it will be there with further support, but where is it? The Feds have trillions of dollars set aside to support the economy however, they have yet to release it or discuss plans to release it. This leaves us to believe that the Federal Reserve is waiting for the market to “need” it. We expect the next round of selloffs will force the Federal Reserve to announce new liquidity plans, possible 10-year yield targeting which will enable true yield curve control that is currently being witnessed in Japan. The Fed has more “ammo” left but until they release this ammo the markets will be extremely volatile with this new short-term downtrend. In times like these, it is important to not panic and maintain the long-term view as the market will eventually come back. Yet it is important to capitalize on times like these to achieve real alpha in the long-term.<p>

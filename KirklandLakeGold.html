        	<h1>Kirkland Lake Gold</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="row  d-flex align-items-stretch">
          <div class="col-lg-12 faq-item" data-aos="fade-up">

          <p>Kirkland Lake Gold is set to resume its normal-course issuer bid (“NCIB”), in which it will be allowed to purchase up to 10% of its outstanding shares. Last month, Kirkland had paused this program due to potential impacts of COVID 19, however, management now sees that they can put their excess capital to work and focus on returning it to shareholders. This is a very bullish sign for Kirkland and the industry. Recently, Kirkland and almost all the gold and silver miners have seen consolidation as the price of gold and silver have fallen. We expect this decline to pivot soon as the next uptrend will begin leading Kirkland and other miners higher. <p>

          <p>After Kirkland’s scrutinized acquisition of Detour Gold, it has underperformed the GDX (a gold miners index). However, going forward we expect Kirkland to be an outperformer and see it as a good way to make some alpha.<p>

          <p>In Q1 2020, Kirkland was able to produce 330,864 kozs of gold, with an all in sustain cost (AISC) of $776/oz. This led to net earnings of $202.9 million USD ($0.79/share). Along with these outstanding numbers, Kirkland also has a balance sheet like no other gold miner as at March 31, 2020 Kirkland had $530.9 million USD cash on hand. According to management, this cash will be used to create organic growth within its current operations through extensive drilling programs to increase the mineral reserves allowing for continued production growth and also to directly return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs.<p>

          <p>Prior to COVID 19, Kirkland’s 2020 Guidance was roughly 1,500,000 ounces of gold at an AISC of $830/ox. Considering royalty expenses, sustaining capital, growth capital, exploration and corporate costs, at an average price of $1,700 for gold, Kirkland is set to make approximately $930 million USD. These are astonishing numbers, proving the value of Kirkland Lake Gold.<p> 

          <p>Kirkland also has strategic investments in many companies such as Novo Resources, Wallbridge Mining and Osisko Mining. The current value of these investments totals roughly $207 million USD.<p>

          <p>The current market cap of Kirkland Lake Resources is $10.56 billion USD. As a company that is expected to make over $500 million USD in profits, currently holds over $500 million USD in cash and $207 million USD in marketable securities. We find Kirkland Lake Gold as an undervalued miner that will outperform in the coming weeks and months. We think that Kirkland will continue to make strategic investments in the aforementioned companies and look to potential buy them out in order to further increase production.<p>
